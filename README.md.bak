# US Medical Insurance Costs
 Codecademy portfolio project analyzing US Medical Insurance Costs

Scope:

The goal of this project is to analyze data without a list of steps of what I should do and when. I am also using Git for the first time, and will be uploading this to github.

I will analyze the data in insurance.csv to do the below, which were recommended by the project:

  - Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.
  - Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from.
  - Look at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers.
  - Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset.

I will also look to find the below, because I am curious about it:
  - Average age of smokers
  - Do men or women smoke more? I think it is men
  - Average BMI of smokers vs non-smokers

I will also check some general information about this data, sort of like a control. This is because I do not know if this subset of data is a representation of the wider population. Maybe this data subset is primarily people with children, or primarily people who are smokers, or primarily people who are over 50, etc.
  - Average Age
  - Number of people with kids vs no kids
  - % of Male vs Female
  - % of smokers
  
Normally, I think I would have a general idea of where my data came from and if it might be biased. However, in this project I don't know who or how this data was gathered, I just have a CSV of data I'm going to analyze. Maybe I missed some explanation of where this dataset came from??

Either way, I was given no guidance on what to analyze, besides the first four points which were suggested in a hint by the project.
